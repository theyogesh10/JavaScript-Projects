            <div class="text">
                JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web
                browsers. It enables dynamic content like animations, form validation, and asynchronous operations like
                fetching data. It works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the user experience on websites.

            <div class="heading">What is a variable in JavaScript?</div>
            <div class="text">
                A variable is a named container used to store data values, which can be changed during program
                execution. Declared with let, const, or var, variables hold data such as numbers, strings, or objects,
                which can be referenced and manipulated throughout the program.

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="heading">What is a data type in JavaScript?</div>
            <div class="text">
                JavaScript has various data types, including string, number, boolean, object, undefined, null, symbol,
                and bigint. These types determine the kind of value that can be stored in a variable and define the
                operations that can be performed on it.

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="heading">What is an array in JavaScript?</div>
            <div class="text">
                An array is a list-like object that stores multiple values in a single variable, indexed by numbers.
                Arrays can hold values of any data type and can be accessed or manipulated using their index, with
                methods like .push(), .pop(), and .map() for modification.

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="heading">What is a function in JavaScript?</div>
            <div class="text">
                A function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can take
                parameters and return a value. They help organize code by dividing it into smaller, manageable pieces
                that can be invoked multiple times throughout the program.

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="heading">What is a loop in JavaScript?</div>
            <div class="text">
                A loop repeats a block of code multiple times, allowing for efficient execution of repetitive tasks.
                Common loops are for, while, and do...while, and they can iterate over arrays or perform actions a set
                number of times until a condition is met.

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="heading">What is an object in JavaScript?</div>
            <div class="text">
                An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be any
                data type. Objects represent real-world entities and are used to store related information, such as user
                details or settings, in a structured way.
